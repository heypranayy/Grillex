      <Heading>1. CLASSIC WOODEN PERGOLA</Heading>
      <P>
        The classic wooden pergola remains a favorite choice among homeowners
        due to its timeless appeal and natural beauty. Typically constructed
        from durable woods like cedar or redwood, these pergolas offer a warm,
        rustic charm that complements various architectural styles. Wooden
        pergolas can be left in their natural state to weather over time or
        treated with stains and sealants to maintain their color and longevity.

            description:
              "In open-plan offices or homes, metal partitions can create private areas without the need for permanent walls. They can divide a large room into smaller, functional spaces such as meeting rooms, workstations, or cozy nooks. This flexibility is especially valuable in commercial settings where the need for privacy and collaboration can change frequently.",
